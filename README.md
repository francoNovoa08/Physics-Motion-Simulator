# Physics-Motion-Simulator
A Python-based physics motion simulation tool that models and visualizes projectile motion and two-dimensional motion using matplotlib. Includes a CLI interface, reusable functions for physics calculations, and unit tests using pytest for key functions like velocity breakdown, float range generation, and displacement.
